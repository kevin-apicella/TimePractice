# TimePractice

This file is an educational app that contains three separate games for 4th grade elementary school students in Kobe, Japan.  It was created with pygame and packaged using pyisntaller.  

Each game was developed in a weekly cadence across three weeks.  After the third week, I spent a day or two putting the apps together and gave them to students to take home over the summer.  In summary, this app was developed in about 23 days, with a weekly breakdown of:

Fri: Class - After school teacher meeting
Sat-Tue: Create functional app
Wed: QA with other 4th grade teachers
Thur: Final alterations and packaging of app

This application incorporates target grammar/language from the textbooks, as well as accompanying pictures.  The voice recordings are of myself, and might come off as a bit comical, but it was done to mimic the way I taught it in class.  Ex: Seven ooOOO' eight (7:08) or Twenty (minor pause) four.  (The reason for this is to leverage similarities and differences in the Japanese counting system).
